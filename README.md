# Association Rule Mining

This Python script demonstrates Association Rule Mining using the `arules` library. Association Rule Mining is a data mining technique that discovers patterns or associations in a dataset, such as which items are frequently bought together in a market basket analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `arules`
- `arulesViz`

You can install these libraries using R package manager or install them manually.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the R script (`association_rule_mining.R`) in your preferred R environment.

3. Make sure to install and load the required libraries if you haven't already:

```R
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```

4. The script loads the "Groceries" dataset provided by the `arules` package as an example dataset. If you want to use your own dataset, replace the dataset loading part with your data.

5. Execute the code sections step by step or as needed.

6. The script generates frequent itemsets and association rules based on different discretization methods for a sample dataset.

## Customization

You can customize the script by adjusting the parameters, changing the dataset, or modifying the discretization methods to fit your specific use case.

## Results

The script generates frequent itemsets and association rules for different discretization methods and displays the results. You can analyze these results to identify interesting patterns in your dataset.



## Acknowledgments

- This script uses the `arules` library for association rule mining.
- It provides examples of different discretization methods and their impact on rule generation.
